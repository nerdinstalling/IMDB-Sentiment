AI-Sentiment-Analysis-on-IMDB-Dataset


Introduction

* Given the availability of a large volume of online review data (Amazon, IMDB, etc.), sentiment analysis becomes increasingly important. In this project, a sentiment classifier is built which evaluates the polarity of a piece of text being either positive or negative.



Getting the Dataset

* The "Large Movie Review Dataset"(*) shall be used for this project. The dataset is compiled from a collection of 50,000 reviews from IMDB. The numbers of positive and negative reviews are equal. Negative reviews have scores less or equal than 4 out of 10 while a positive review have score greater or equal than 7 out of 10. Neutral reviews are not included. The 50,000 reviews are divided evenly into the training and test set.
